# This is not a Search Engine

## Why is this not a search engine?

The purpose of this website was to mimic the Google search engine. You might've been fooled if you didn't look twice!
The home page looks nearly identical to the Google search page. At the current production stage, most of the buttons are just for decoration and not functional.
The search bar is one of the few functional components. You can search up anything that is in the (limited) database. The search algorithm was implemented using a prefix trie, so the beginning of your search prompt must match exactly what is in the database. The suggestions that show up when you haven't typed anything are all the options you can try. However, you might've noticed that that isn't enough to get your query to go through. Have you tried using the magic word? (Scroll to the bottom of the README for the magic word)

## Where are my Wikipedia results!?

That's right. The purpose of this website was not to provide you on information about your query, but rather to display a cool idea I had inspired by it. So far, this is the comprehensive list of all of the searches:
> [why is the sky blue](#why-is-the-sky-blue)
> [i think im happy](#i-think-im-happy)
> [crowdstrike](#crowdstrike)
> [what day is it today](#what-day-is-it-today)

## Why is the sky blue

Perhaps one of the most searched questions. That's why it deserved a page in the first working version of this website. This page uses parallax to show a sun rising as you scroll down the page. The 2nd search result takes you to a poem.

## I think im happy

One of my favorite shirts has this written on it. In honor of this shirt, this page is filled with the most vibrant expression of happiness: emojis! Clicking on any of the search results takes you to a page filled with emojis with matching backgrounds.

## Crowdstrike

One of the biggest tech failures of 2024, the blue screen of death. This page mimics the error screen that popped up on millions of Windows devices and also includes a QR code for the Wikipedia article about this iconic event.

## What day is it today

I hope you know what day it is today. It's ok if you don't because this website will display your schedule for you. Well, it just has my schedule for now... 
Clicking on any search result will lead you either to a special page celebrating the occasion if that day was a holiday (there's only a page celebrating birthdays for now), or a page representing my confusion at why you would think anything would happen that day.

## Magic word

Did you scroll here for the magic word? I'm disappointed that you haven't learned to say this whenever you ask someone for help. Of course search engines have feelings too! It won't help you until you say "please".

## Secret page

Did you stumble upon something strange when you entered invalid searches too many times? Don't worry, you aren't stuck. This page was just designed to give you a little panic that something might've gone wrong. It doesn't actually do anything harmful to your computer.
