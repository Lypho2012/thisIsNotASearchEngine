        Now I know why the sky is blue...<br/>
        At last I know the score...<br/>
        Though once I didn't have a clue,<br/>
        Today I know for sure...<br/>
        I also know the reason why<br/>
        The rain falls from above -<br/>
        I believe the heavenly sky<br/>
        Once fell and lost in love...<br/>
        That's why dark clouds must first appear<br/>
        Before the thunder storm<br/>
        And why each raindrop's like a tear<br/>
        The sky was forced to form...<br/>
        Love tends to promise everything<br/>
        Yet takes it all away!<br/>
        At first it makes you want to sing<br/>
        Then fills you with dismay!<br/>
        No wonder, then, the sky is blue<br/>
        Then sometimes black as night!<br/>
        For love tempts Man then says, 'Adieu! '<br/>
        Then laughs with all its might!<br/>
        <br/>
